functions : introduction
1. can we create a list of function names? can we traverse this
   list and apply these functions one after another to a 
   given arg ?
2. can we define the fn more than once ? what happens if we call
   such function?
3. can a function have more than one nested function ?
4. can a function return a list of nested functions ?
5. can we undecorate a decorated fn? get back the old function?

Topics covered today require a bit of reading and experimenting.
Look at python visualizers to help understand what happens at
runtime in Python. Donot compare with the C runtime model.
