- while programming in Python (for that, any language), 
  understand its philosophy
- do not write 'C' programs in Python
- remember division of int in Python3.x gives a float result
- in 'C', check the concept of sequence point, evaluation of operands
  and operators

Questions:
1. What is the concept of iterable? list is iterable. range object is also
   iterable. What is the difference?
2. When do we increase the indentation? When do we decrease the indentation?
3. In a for loop, is the loop variable a copy of the element of the iterable
   or it is a reference to element of the iterable?
4. can we say  3 in range(5) ? How would in operator work?
5. How do we reverse 
   a string?
   a list?  
6. what could 
   a, b = b, a
   mean? what if a, b are simple type variables? what if a and b are
   of different type? what if a and b are of reference type?
7. what could this mean ?
   while ... :
   	...
   else:
	...

8. what is the difference?
   a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
   b = a
   c = a[:]

9. a = [10, 20, 30, 40, 60, 70, 80]
   i = 4
   x = 50
   How to insert x in posn i in list a ?
   (one line code!)

10. What happens?
    a = "PESIT"
    a.upper()
    print(a)
